# MajorDepressiveDisorder

This repository contains custom inhouse R scripts used for statistics and generating figures for scRNA-seq data in Major Depressive Disorder project, as well as count matrix and annotations for ATACseq data.

The count matrix for scRNA-seq data is generated with default setting by 10x cellranger.
